ConnectednessApproach::PlotNetwork(dyc)

##The total connectedness index (TCI) illustrates the average impact a shock in one series has on all others.
PlotTCI(dyc, ylim=c(0,100))

## On the one side, the total directional connectedness TO others, TOi, represents the impact series i has on all other series
PlotTO(dyc, ylim=c(0,130))

##while the total directional connectedness FROM, FROMi, others demonstrates the impact all series have on series i.
PlotFROM(dyc, ylim=c(0,100))

## Interestingly, the average of all TO or all FROM values is equal to the TCI.
## The difference between the total directional connectedness TO and FROM others results in the net total directional connectedness, NETi, which illustrates the net influence on the predefined network. 
## If NETi>0(NETi<0), we know that the impact series i has on all others is larger (smaller) than the impact all others have on series i. 
## Thus, series i is considered as a net transmitter (receiver) of shocks and hence driving (driven by) the network.

PlotNET(dyc, ylim=c(-50,50))

## On the bilateral level, the net pairwise directional connectedness measure, NPSOij, is of major interest. 
## If NPSOij>0 (NPSOij<0) it means that series i has a larger (smaller) impact on series j than series j has on series i.
PlotNPDC(dyc, ylim=c(-10,10))

## Another interesting plot is the net pairwise transmission plot which illustrates how many series series i dominates. 
## If the network consists of k series, one series can at maximum dominate kâˆ’1 series. This plot summarizes the net transmission mechanism of each series.
